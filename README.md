# React Boilerplate for FiveM

Just a simple boilerplate for react.

`yarn install`

Building uses rewire, so you can edit that inside `scripts/build-non-split.js`.

There is now also a [typescript boilerplate](https://github.com/itsxScrubz/React-Boilerplate/tree/typescript) in a seperate branch courtesy of [itschip](https://github.com/itschip). :)
